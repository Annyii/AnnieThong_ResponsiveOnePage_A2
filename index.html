            <p><span>MARKET</span><br><br>All of Olabukoo's idea has come straight from scratch and is fully out of olabukko's mind which makes this art their version of a market, specifically located in China, Hong Kong but doesn't exist. Since Olakuboo missed his hometown and family there, they wanted to make a their own version of a china based market so they could share the artwork with their family. In the artwork, the people that are visible are the poeple that mean the most to olabukoo.</p>

This art expresses a lot of different emotions when exploring it with your eyes. It gives emotions of newness, nostalgia, and warmth. Back in 2014 PhonoForest said they wanted always wanted to make different versions of mountains with houses and this is their second one out of the four they made.</p>

The glowing red at the bottom indicates how the futute is going to ruin us as a society because of all the techonology that is going to be sued in the futur. There are also not many people, most likely due to the robots in these big buildings have tooken over cities. This for sure looks cool but it provokes this ominous, anxious feel to it with how big everything is to the point we viewers can't see it properly.</p>
